        <h1 class="font1">Air Jordan 17 Retro</h1>
        <p id="about">Released on June 2002 in white and university blue. These shoes were designed by
          Wilson Smith the 3<sup>rd</sup>. My favorite Air Jordan release of all time, they have never been re-released!
          I don't know what Nike's problem is but these shoes are very nice, for a low-cut shoe they were ahead of their time and were very 
          casual for a basketball shoe. They held a certain look that just could not be contended with. Easily interchangeable with a basketball 
          jersey or a dress shirt, I would give anything to own a pair in 2019. I honestly think a petition needs to be written up or something 
          because there is a reason they have released every other colorway of the same shoe but not these. Like the sales
          reflect the success of these shoes and they don't want to have a retail sale wipe out and have to restock them two or three times.
          The design was way ahead of its time and very futuristic for a shoe released so long ago, making an artificial sock for the shoe was 
          an awesome idea and adds to how cool they look. NIKE PLEASE RE-RELASE THIS SHOE! The video is a collector who found a deadstock pair that
          he purchased and unboxed in 2014.
